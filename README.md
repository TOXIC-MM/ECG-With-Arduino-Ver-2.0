# ECG-With-Arduino-Ver-2.0
A Simple App For Monitoring Your Heartbeat Using an Arduino And ECG Sensor AD8232 With BPM

Part 1: 
What is ECG?
An ECG (electrocardiogram) is a test that records the electrical activity of your heart, including the rate and rhythm. It's usually quick and painless.

An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is done to check the heartbeat. It shows how fast or how slow the heart is beating. ECG test results can help your care team diagnose:

1. Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias.
2. A previous heart attack.
3. The cause of chest pain. For example, it may show signs of blocked or narrowed heart arteries.
An ECG also may be done to learn how well a pacemaker and heart disease treatments are working.

Part 2:
How to DIY one with Arduino Mega 2560 and AD8232 Sensor:

First wire up everything according to this table:

Part 3: Test your Project
1. Do a Head to toe assessment on your patient for a better result, you can use this checklist that I tested on my friend: [Checklist.xlsx](https://github.com/TOXIC-MM/ECG-With-Arduino-Ver-2.0/files/15121934/Checklist.xlsx)

2. Connect electrodes to the chest and measure the data with [Better Serial Plotter App](https://github.com/nathandunk/BetterSerialPlotter/releases)
   The first result is captured by BPM.ino and the second one with ECG.ino

4. Optional: Do a pain/stress test on the patient and record the results:
